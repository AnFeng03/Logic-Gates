(Building Instructions) Input the following in the command line:
gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -Wno-unused-function -o programName *.c

(Running Instructions) Input the following in the command line:
./programName


Additional Information:

To handle the functions not provided by the code I decided to create two functions of my own: the NOR and NAND gates. This can be found at the end of gates.c separated by a comment line indiciating my own work. All other implementations I used where provided by the project itself. All circuits are created and tested in my main.c, including the extra credit circuit created using the truth table.
